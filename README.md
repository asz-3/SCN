This document utilizes the dies_aitrans project by the developer of the Akaruzi project to unpack the data files of the Steam version. 

It conducts a proofreading of the patch file's compilation and modifications. 

The game content of the "first six chapters" has been translated and subjected to a round of proofreading (line numbers, character names, or chants). 

It is hoped that someone will discover this project and carry it forward, continuing to complete the full text localization of the game (the heroine's route, i.e., the game content beyond the common route). 

Thank you all.
